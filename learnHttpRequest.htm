<!--
    CORS: protocol that establishes security for communication between
    a browser and multiple "origins" (where "origins" are unique servers).
    Intended to prevent hackers from manipulating a browser accessing two
    servers.
    How it works: Browser acts as a "messenger" to check that the servers it
    is accessing follow CORS protocol, which would make it safe for the browser
    to access that server along with others.
    How to check: click on the "Networks" tab of the debugging window in browsers, 
    and check for "Access-Control-Allow-Origin"
